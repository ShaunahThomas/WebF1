    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>The first lecture consisted of introduction to staff and the unit. Information on the course was given, in terms of how I would be assessed. Schedule of how each semester would run.</p>
    <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl"> Practical: </p>
  <p>Task 0: Keep a log of what you do - I have created this discovery log. Within this discovery log I will be recording what I have done, what I have learnt, what I have observed in each task, and any problems I encounter during lectures, practical’s, or self-studying.</p>
  <p>Task 1: Start working with your VM - I have now encountered my first difficulty, which is the virtual machine. I have no idea what it is used for, but I have been told that I will be using it in this unit and others. Hopefully, I will gain a better understanding of what it is and how to use it. I have however managed to start the server for my virtual machine.</p>
  <p>Task 2: Get the Coursework - I have looked through the course work and feel that I have a good understanding of what I must do. However, I do not know how to approach the topic.</p>
  <p>Task 3: Website Awards - I completed the website awards work sheet.</p>
  <p>Task 4:Choose an Editor - I browsed different text editors. These include the following:</p>
  <ul class="listfordl">
    <li>Atom – I find this really user friendly and appealing.</li>
    <li>Notepad++ - This seems to be very basic and boring to me.</li>
    <li>WebStorm – This is similar to Atom.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Task 5: Further Reading - Reading around the topic.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>Reading on Taylor, A., Alexander, D., Finch, A., & Sutton, D. (2013). Information security management principles. London: BCS.</p>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <h3>Web security</h3>
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>During lecture, I learnt the importance of security. Especially as there are so many techniques that individuals can use to gain access to sensitive information. Examples include phishing, impersonation, physical access (tailgating), and fake software.</p>
<div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>Task 0: Keep a log of what you do - Continue recording in this discovery log.</p>
  <p>Task 1: Work Collaboratively - In a group of 5 we created a document on google drive called “WebF1 Security Policy Task”. In this document, we collaborated our ideas for task 2, 3 and 4.</p>
  <p>Task 2: Identify all information - In the document that we created, we inputted the different kinds of information that we generate on a day to day basis. This was quite difficult to understand as I didn’t really understand what information we were talking about. However, after an example was given I understood what I had to do for the task. </p>
  <p>Task 3: Categorise that information - Once we had identified all the information that we could think of, we then categorised the information into traditional groups. For example, secret, sensitive and public.</p>
  <p>Task 4: Processing information - We then identified how the information might be received or classified. For example, third party.</p>

    <h3>Literature Review</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>In this lecture, I learnt what a literature review is. I also learnt what makes a good literature review. This lecture also taught me ways of approaching the topic and how to find trust worthy sources with valid information. Furthermore, I was able to gain techniques in planning the review.</p>
      <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>Task 0:  How to begin - I began to think about my literature review and ways I can approach it. I recorded the initial search terms for “Mitigating personal information exposure on the web”. I used coggle.it to make a mind map of ideas and emerging themes.</p>
  <p>Task 1: Research - I began to plan my search by using the terms I established in task 0. I searched on the University of Portsmouth library website for potential resources. I was still unsure exactly what I was looking for.</p>
  <p>Task 2: Iterate - From the sources that came up, I had to evaluate if they were appropriate and fit into the theme of the topic. Also, I had to evaluate the reliability of the source.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>Additional reading.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">Other comments:</p>
  <p>I find it hard to understand the topic. I’ve never done further reading into a topic so I found it quite hard to differentiate what sources were valid.</p>

    <h3>Academic Writing</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>This lecture focused on the importance of academic writing, how to write well, what does an academic writing look like, and referencing. I was able to gain an understanding of how vital using different voices was in connecting with the audience. The lecture also consisted of things to avoid and not to avoid when writing. The marking criteria was also given.</p>
      <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>Within this practical I had to improve the text that was given in each task. During most of the task I could replace words with ease. However, some task I found that the words I used was not suitable in the context that was given.</p>
  <p>Task 0: How to begin – Making a copy of the worksheet to edit it.</p>
  <p>Task 1: Replacing Phrasal Verbs with Cues </p>
  <p>Task 2: Replacing Phrasal Verbs without Cues </p>
  <p>Task 3: Choosing Appropriate Adjectives/Expressions </p>
  <p>Task 4: Choosing Formal Words and Phrases </p>
  <p>Task 5: Contraction Alternatives </p>
  <p>Task 6: Avoiding Personal and Subjective Writing </p>
  <p>Task 7: Exercise Caution </p>
  <p>Task 8: Accurate Formal Writing </p>
  <p>Task 9: Practice </p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>Additional reading for literature review. </p>
<p class="headersfordl">Other comments:</p>
  <p>I found some task to be challenging as I couldn’t find an appropriate word that would fit the sentence. Finding a valid theme for the literature review was very difficult because all the information I found were very different. However, I began to have a much better understanding of the topic.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to Mark-up</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture: </p>
        <p>This lecture consists of information regarding websites. Understanding that there are layers to a page. </p>
    <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>During this practical session, I created a simple web page and uploaded it to my virtual machine. </p>
  <p>Task 0: Create a Web Page – I used atom to create a webpage.</p>
  <p>Task 1: Upload your web page to your Virtual Machine – I used WinSCP software to upload the webpage I created in task 1 to my Virtual Machine.</p>
  <p>Task 2: Start your web server – In this task I connected to my Virtual Machine and ran the web server, to see the website online.</p>
  <p>Task 3: Create and upload your own web page – I then used the template that was given and edited the code to include my name, course, and student id.</p>
  <p>Task 4: Further Work</p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>None </p>
<p class="headersfordl">Other comments:</p>
  <p>I previously tried 3 different text editors and found atom to be the best one that suited me. As I previously didn’t know what the virtual machine was used for, I started to gain greater understanding of what it is and why I need it.</p>

<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>As I didn’t have any lectures or practical’s in webf1 this week I focused on my literature review. I began to write up my literature review.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">Other comments:</p>
  <p>I was able to identify social engineering and pharming as themes. During my research, I found that a lot of reasons as to why exposure of personal information happens is because of social engineering and pharming. Which is why I used it as a theme to talk about ways of mitigating exposure personal information from social engineering and pharming. Writing up the literature review was a struggle. I was able I was still unsure of how to structure the literature review. </p>

    <h3>Separating Form and Content</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>In this lecture, the focus was the separation of form and content. It also identified the difference between descriptive and procedural mark-up. The lecture observed that descriptive mark-up is preferable for several reasons, these include the following:</p>
        <ul class="listfordl">
          <li>ease of maintenance </li>
          <li>smaller overall file sizes </li>
          <li>increased semantic encoding, leading eventually to</li>
          <li>more content that can be processed on our behalf by machines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The lecture also gave an induction into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and why it’s important to use.</p>
<div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>Task 0: Preparation – In this task I created a folder called style. Within the folder, I also created a html document that contained the example code that I was given. I have never made a stylesheet before, so this was new to me.</p>
  <p>Task 1: An Embedded Stylesheet – In this task I created a stylesheet.</p>
  <p>Task 2: A Linked Stylesheet – The task was to link the stylesheet I made in task 1 to the html document that I created in task 0.</p>
  <p>Task 3: Class & ID Selectors – In this task I added more elements to the style sheet. Those elements include class selectors and id selectors. Examples:</p>
  <p>Class Selectors:</p>
  <p>In mystyle.css:</p>
  <p>.First {</p>
	<p>color: red;</p>
  <p>}</p>

  <p>.Second {</p>
	<p>background: black;</p>
  <p>}</p>

  <p>In linked.html:</p>

	<p>&lt;p class="First Second"&gt; Hello &lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <p>Id Selectors:</p>
  <p>In mystyle.css:</p>

  <p>#Section1 {</p>
	<p>background: blue;</p>
  <p>}</p>

  <p>In linked.html:</p>

	<p>&lt;p id="Section1 " &gt;Hello&lt;/p &gt;</p>

  <p>Task 4: Read, Discover, Experiment, Learn – This task insisted on reading up more on CSS to get a better understanding of the things you can do with it.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>Writing up Literature Review</p>
<p class="headersfordl">Other comments:</p>
  <p>I found more themes for my literature review. These were Malware, Trojan horses, Spyware, Worms. I am lacking information on Trojan horses and Worms, which I need to do more research on. </p>

    <h3>Addressing the Web</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
      <p>In this week's lecture URLs and hyperlinks were discussed. Information was given on how to form a URL and how to use the anchor tag to place links in HTML.</p>
       <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>Task 0: Preparation – In this task I created a folder called “links”. Within the folder, I then created a html document called “index”, that contained the example content.</p>
  <p>Task 1: A list of your favourite links – In this task I had to link 4 websites, which are the following:</p>
  <ul class="listfordl">
    <li>https://www.youtube.com/</li>
    <li>https://www.facebook.com/</li>
    <li>https://twitter.com/?lang=en</li>
    <li>https://www.instagram.com/</li>
  </ul>
    <p>I used the following format to implement the links:</p>
      <p>&lt;section&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;h1&gt;My Favourite Websites:&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;ul id=extlinks&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;/section&gt;</p>
    <p>This was all new to me.</p>
    <p>Task 2: Relative links – For this task I created 3 new html documents called “about”, “studies”, and “music”. Within each page, I created relevant content. I then linked each of the pages to each page.</p>
    <p>Task 3: Targets and fragments – This task showed me how to make the link open in a new window.</p>
    <p>Task 4: Read, Discover, Experiment, Learn – This was an extra challenge that I manage to accomplish. I had put the 3 new pages that I created into a subfolder and change the relative links so they work. </p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>Extra Reading and writing Literature Review.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">Other comments:</p>
  <p>As I struggled with finding information on Trojan horses and worms last week, I did extra research to find valid information. I could find the information I needed. The only issue was rewording the information to make sense and understandable.</p>

      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>This lecture focused on design. There were 3 main points from this lecture, which are the following:</p>
        <p>Suitability</p>
        <ul class="listfordl">
          <li>now the purpose, know the audience, and focus on that intersection.</li>
          <li>Know that every design choice impacts every other design choice and every user interaction, and choose wisely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Simplicity</p>
        <ul class="listfordl">
          <li>Include only what is necessary, nothing else.</li>

        <p>This lecture consisted of java script. The lecturers demonstrated the use of using scripting by implementing a stick figure game.</p>
        <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>Within this practical I played the stick figure game that was shown in the lecture. I also continued with the creation of my website by adding a navigation bar into it. I found it difficult to make the navigation responsive when the screen size reduced to a mobile size. The navigation bar would be positioned in an unorganised way.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>I created a CSS file and linked it with my html document. I also focused on making the navigation bar responsive. I was able to find a responsive navigation bar from http://codepen.io/ImBobby/pen/mxqKL  which I used and changed to fit my design.</p>

    <h3>Website Marking Scheme</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>In lecture, we looked at the marking scheme for the website.</p>
      <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>In practical the work focused on some of the standards that make the web work. I worked directly with the specifications. Within this practical I also validated my HTML and CSS file. There were a few errors that I corrected.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>In my own time, I continued with making my website. I made the other 3 pages and linked them all together using the &lt;link&gt; element. There were a few issues with the resizing of the website on an iPhone. I managed to do some research as to why my website would scale down. The issue was that iPhone tend to keep the desktop view, therefore I had to add the element &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt; so that the website would resize according to the platform it is viewed on.</p>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>This lecture focused on accessibility. The main things that were discussed was reasons as to why we should make websites accessible, consider the types of adjustments we may have to make when creating website, and to be aware of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.</p>
      <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>Task 0: Simulating Impairment – in this task I worked in a small group of 3. As a group, we each simulated a physical impairment using props. We carried this out through the duration of the practical.</p>
  <p>Task 1: An Introduction to Evaluation – within this task I had to evaluate the accessibility of the front page of Rich’s website using POUR.</p>
  <p>Task 2: Evaluate Your Site – In this task I had to evaluate my own website.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>Continued with my website. I focused on the layout of the page and making sure it would adjust when optimizing the screen size. I also added images to my portfolio page. I used this website http://geekgirllife.com/place-text-over-images-on-hover-without-javascript/ as a guide to the image layout.</p>

    <h3>Scalable Graphics on the Web</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p class="headersfordl">Lecture:</p>
        <p>This lecture was on Scalable Vector Graphics(SVG).</p>
        <div class="readmoretext">
<p class="headersfordl">Practical:</p>
  <p>This practical session involved a task experimenting with SVG. I also continued with adding content to my website.</p>
<p class="headersfordl">My Time:</p>
  <p>In my own time I continued with the making of my website. I added a show more button in the discovery log which I got from this website http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28225717/how-to-make-read-more-option-with-html-css.</p>

    <h3>Final Week</h3>
    <div class="readmorewrap">
      <p>This was the final week, which I had to complete my website. I struggled alot because there were so much work to do in a short amount of time. I ended up staying up all night to ensure my website was completed and free from errors.</p>
        <div class="readmoretext">
          <p>Overall my whole experience of WEBF1 has been very good. I feel I have developed various of skills from writing to coding in html. If I was to do this again I think I would have taken this Discovery Log seriously and keep it up to date. Therefore I would have a better undertstanding of my progression as an individual throughout this unit.</p>
